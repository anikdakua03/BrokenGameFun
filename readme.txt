+++++++ Broken Game +++++++++++++

whose sum will end  in 100 the last man to add will win the game .
Condition  is , you can add between 1 - 10 
like between 2 people ,
A start with 5 . then B can add anything between 1- 10 , so this continues 
and whose adding will end up in 100 , that man will win .

Trick to always win :
A = 4, B = 11-4 = 7 ; (B will always add the result number = 11 - A s choosen number ) 
i think it doesnt matter who start the game ,
